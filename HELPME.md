# Help üòä

First and foremost, this list is to motivate you. If you fail to achieve your targets, that's okay. The progress bars will still show you your efforts to complete them, and that's an achievement in itself.

## Resolution title 

- Should not be long 
- Use Emojis üòÉüí™üèºü•¥
- Always use progress badge

## Progress Badgde 

I have used [shields.io](https://shields.io/) for creating badge. It's very simple to create one.

**Example:**
let's say, we want to create a badge of 30% completed Resolutions 

`https://img.shields.io/badge/<progress/completed>-<% of completion>25-<color>.svg`

so url will look like

`https://img.shields.io/badge/progress-30%25-yellow.svg`

and output will be

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/progress-50%25-yellow.svg)

Progress in %  | Color
-------------  | -------------
0-20%          | red
21-60%         | yellow
61-99%         | green
100%           | darkgreen

## Resolution content

#### Declaration
Just after your resolution title, define your resoltion as clearly as you can. like this

#### The checklist (Optional)
If your resolution is listical and long like *"I will read 5 books"* or *"I will go 5 new places"* use checkbox. It's simple to use just add this before each item `- [ ]` and if it's completed use  `- [x]`.

Output you will get will be like this.

#### Progress stamps (Optional)
You can also registered small achivements with help of progress stamps. Just add them in bullet list with date stamp and progress. For example if you want to use this for progress stamps 

* Jan 19: My weight is 90kg
	
* Mar 19: My weight is 85kg
